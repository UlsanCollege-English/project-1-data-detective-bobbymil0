# P1: Data Detective

## Summary

This project analyzes a text file, counts word frequencies, shows the top **N** words, and reports one extra insight. In this version, the extra insight is **lexical diversity** — the ratio of unique words to total words.

## Dataset

- **File:** `data/sample.txt`
- **Why I chose it:** I used a short sports-themed text because it is easy to verify by hand and includes repeated words, punctuation, and mixed sentence structure. That makes it a good small dataset for testing frequency analysis.

## How to run

```bash
pytest -q
python -m src.project
```

## Approach

1. Load text from a file.
2. Normalize the text by converting it to lowercase.
3. Tokenize the text into words using regular expressions.
4. Count word frequencies with a dictionary.
5. Sort and display the top N words.
6. Report an extra insight: most frequent word, total words, unique words, and lexical diversity.

## Complexity

### `count_words`
- **Time:** `O(w)`
- **Space:** `O(u)`
- **Why:** The function visits each word once and stores one count per unique word.

### `top_n_words`
- **Time:** `O(u log u)`
- **Space:** `O(u)`
- **Why:** The unique-word dictionary is sorted by frequency, so the sort dominates the running time.

## Edge-case checklist

- [x] empty file
- [x] punctuation-heavy input
- [x] repeated words
- [x] uppercase/lowercase differences
- [x] `n <= 0`

## Assistance & sources

- **AI used?** Y
- **What it helped with:** polishing the README, improving edge-case handling, and checking test coverage.
- **Other sources:** Python documentation for `re` and `pathlib`.

## Design note (150–250 words)

For this project, I selected a short football-themed text file as the dataset. I chose it because it is small enough to check manually, but still includes repeated vocabulary, punctuation, and natural sentence patterns that make frequency analysis meaningful. My main design decision was to keep the program simple and readable: one function loads the file, one tokenizes the text, one counts frequencies, and one returns the top N results. This makes the code easy to test and easy to improve later.

The easiest part of the project was using a dictionary to store word counts, because that matches the problem directly and runs efficiently. The harder part was making the behavior reliable for edge cases such as empty files, capitalization differences, punctuation-heavy input, and invalid values like `n <= 0`. I also wanted the output to look clear when the program is run from the command line.

If I were improving the project next, I would let the user choose any text file from the command line and add a simple bar chart of the most frequent words for a more visual presentation.
